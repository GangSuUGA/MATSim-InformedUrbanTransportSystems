## 1. Introduction 

### 1.1 Motivation 
- There is a growing appreciation of the importance in developed societies of networks (or lifelines) of various kinds, such as water supply, energy supply, sewage disposal, communication and of course transportation. 
- Mobility and accessibility are major determinants of lifestyle and prosperity.

- A rigorous consideration of the kinds of land use and transport issues just raised requires the appropriate tools to analyse tranportation networks and travel behaviour within them.
