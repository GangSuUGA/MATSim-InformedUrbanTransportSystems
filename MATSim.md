________________________________________________

 - MATSim performs integral microscopic simulation of **resulting traffic flows** and **the congestion** they produce.  


 - Implemented in **Java**. 


 - MATSim is based on the **co-evolutionary principle**. **Every agent** repeatedly optimizes its **daily activity schedule** while in competition for space-time slots with all other agents on the transportation infrastructure. This is somewhat similar to the route assignment iterative cycle, but goes **beyond route assignment** by incorporating other choice dimensions like **time choice**, **mode choice**, or **destination choice** into the **iterative loop**.
