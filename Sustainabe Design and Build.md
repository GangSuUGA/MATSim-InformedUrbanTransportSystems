üåáAtmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is trapping heat radiated from the earth's surface, thereby causing global warming and environmental problems such as greenhouses effect, startospheric ozone depletion, acid precipitation, and flooding of coastal settlements. 

## Climate Change 
- The climate change mechanism refers to a change in weather pattern's statistical distribution when the changes last for a long period of time. 
- Based on scientific facts, climate is changing and increase in the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a primary cause of this changes. 

### **Forcing mechanisms or climate forcing** 
refer to factors that are likely to shape the climate. There are either external or internal forcing mechanisms. 
- Extenal climate forcing can either be natural, for example, volcano eruption, the Earth's orbit ot changes in solar output, anthropogenic, for instance, greenhouse dust and gases increased emissions. 
- Internal climate forcing are natural procedures, such as thermohaline circulation, that exist within the climate system itself (Scientifically, biosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere). 

### Internal Climate Forcing
- Because the **ocean** has hundreds of times more mass than the atmosphere, hence, extremely high thermal inertia, it is possible for the oceanic facets of these particular circulations to create changeability on centennial timescales. 
- For instance, modification to ocean processes such as circulation of the **thermohaline** plays a major part in the redistribution of heat within the world's oceans, which as well takes a significant role in climate alteration. 
- The term thermohaline is derived from the word "thermo", which refers to temperature, and "haline," which refers to the content of salt, the components which together determine the seawater density. 
- Thermohaline circulation is usually a part of the extensive ocean circulation that is driven by international density gradients generated by freshwater and surface heat fluxes. 

### External Climate Forcing 
- Modifications in the periodic supply of sunlight reaching the surface of the Earth and the way it is supplied across the world are caused by orbital differences in the motion of the Earth. 
- **Earth's axis procession**, modifications in the **Earth's axis tilt angle of rotation**, and **differences in Earth's eccentricity** are the three kinds of kinematic change. 
- If these three kinds of kinematic change are jointed together, they will produce **Milankovitch cycles**, which have great effect on the Earth's climate and are visible for their appearance in the stratigraphic record, their connection with the Sahara retreat and advance, and for their connection to interglacial and glacial periods. 
- Heat from radioactive compound decay, tidal energy from the moon, and geothermal energy from the Earth's core are other sources of energy input to the Earth besides the Sun, which is the leading source. 

### Climate Change Evidence

- Among the most sensitive climate change indicators are glaciers, whose size is calculated by a mass balance amid snow input and the melt output. 
- Glacier always retreat as temperatures become warm except in the case where the partcipation of snow rises to make up for added melt. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/146868521-2373a57a-99d9-46fb-8063-a827a37113d8.png)
- Over the last many years, the decrease in Arctic sea ice, both in thickness and extent, is more proof for rapid change in the Earth's climate. 
- Based on the satellite observation, presently sea ice is decreasing at a rate of 13.2% for each decade. 
- Other indictors of climate changing are **vegetation, forest genetic resources, cloud cover and precipitation, and sea level change**. 

### **Motivation and Conclusion** 
- Despite some impact by natural process, the evidence stated that climate change is mainly caused by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuel, land-use changes, and misuse of natural resources. 
- During the past several decades, there has been serious concern over the dangers associated with the accumulation of GHGs (Greenhouse Gases) in the atmosphere. 
- Hazardous air pollutants are usually emitting from fossil fuel and gas extraction and processing industries; hydrocarbon and dioxin emissions are caused by the use and combustion of petrol and diesel oil for transport; and radionuclides are released during the burning/combustion of gas, petroleum, coal, and heavy fuel oil. 
- Excessive concentraions of these pollutants have demonstrated health, welfare, and ecological effects felt globally in addition to climate change. 
- The changing climate is thus impacting the global environment severely, such as causing flood or draught, the influence of agricultural crop yields, affect human health, and destroy ecosystems are causing due to this climate change. 
- üßö**So, what can we do because we are the first generation with the tools is to see how global environmental system is running toward danger due to the conventional system of natural resource consumption, at the same time, we are the last generation with the tools to prevent these dangers.** üßö
- Indeed, we can individually do something great by applying sustainable technologies in every sector and collectively helping to create gloval view for the development of the sustainable technology for confirming a cleaner and greener earth.

## Introduction: 
### 1.1 **Sustainable Environment**:
the biological systems must remain productive and diverse for an indefinite period of time. 

### 1.2 **Sustainable energy** 
is an urgent demand to ‚≠ê**serve the needs of the present without compromissing the ability of future generations to meet their needs**‚≠ê. 
- Types of renewable energy: hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind energy, wave power, geothermal energy, bioenergy, tidal power, and technologies to improve energy effciency. 

- Changes that need to be made on the present-day conventional energy consumption will not only be on **how energy is supplied** but also on **how it is used**, and it is important to reduce the volume of energy needed to deliver different goods and/or services. 

### 1.3 **Sustainable building** 
refer to both the structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building's life cycle from planning to design, constructure, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. 
- All over the world, buildings have been identified to consume very large portions of natural resources including water and energy. In the present day, buildings are responsible for 40% of the worldwide CO2 emissions, which is equal to 9 billion tons of carbon dioxide yearly, and by 2050, these emissions are likely to double. 
- Utilizing sunlight via photovoltaic equipment, active annd passive solar, trees and planets via rainwater runoff reduction, rain gardens, and green roofs. 
- Utilizing low-effect constructing materials and using permeable concrete or packed gravel rather than asphalt or conventional concrete to improve groundwater replenishment . 
- **Design clean building**: identifying "green" materials of building from indigenous sources, reducing loads, optimizing systems, and finally producing on-site renewable energy. 

- **Traditional (Building&Transportation) Infrastructure** is causing losses lands. Progressively, the biodiversity loss within the environment mainly from the habitat fragmentation and loss. (as well as agriculture.) 

### 1.4 **Sustainable Transportation**: 
the advanced vehicle technology to be used for road, water, or air transport by using renewable and clean energy, where the infrastructure should be able to accommodate the clean fuel-operated transport to mitigate energy and traffic jam crisis. 

- **Traditional Transport systems** have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for nearly 28% of world energy conventional consumption, and it is causing proportional climate change and adverse environmental impact. 

### 1.5 **Water**: 
covers 75% of the Earth's surface, out of this, 97% is the salty water of the oceans and **only 3% freshwater**, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. (glaciers: 69%, **groundwater: 30%**, whereas **all lakes, rivers and swamps: 0.3%**. 

- Although, the supply of freshwater is constantly replenished through precipitation because of the water cycle, within the last several decades, groundwater strata have been getting lower nearly 10m, scaring the groundwater finite level in the near future. 

- In contrast, rising urbanization contaminates freshwater supplies, thereby triggering adverse environmental impact, which eventually alarms the survival of all living beings on Earth due to the shortage of drinkable water near future. 

- **Importance of Water**: The living body metabolic (catabolism and anabolism); Plant photosynthesis and respiration; Agriculture, Home and Industry. 
- In catabolism, water is utilized to break the bonds within large molecules to create smaller molecules, and in anabolism, water is detached from molecules to create larger molecules. 
- Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off hydrogen from oxygen in water. Afterward, hydrogen is mixed with carbon dioxide (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose that is utilized as their food and release oxygen to balance the ecosystem. 

- **Sustainable Water**: (much more scientifically and technologically advanced research and development must be applied) 
1. physical and chemical treatment processes for water and wastewater treatment process, 
2. environment biotechnology for use in the water resource management and bioremediation, and utilize wastewater into useful product, 
3. watershed and wetland management to reduce the water loss, 
4. advanced environment engineering design to mitigate the groundwater, 
5. sustainable water resource development as a new source of water supply.

## Environment

### 2.1 Air 
- Currently the atmospheric CO2 is 400 ppm Ôºàcontinues to rapid increase),  60,000 ppm means all living being will die in 30 mins. 
- [**CO2 Link**](https://netl.doe.gov/coal/carbon-storage/faqs/carbon-dioxide-101)

### 2.2 Wastewater 
- The conventional wastewater treatment has the lack of suspended particulate matter analysis and good analytical approaches which results in aquatic environment and agricultural land got pollutant and hence poison organisms. 
- Monitoring spatial and temporal variability of Emerging Contaminates in wastewater and river water will become important. 

### 2.3 Land 
- A vital component in comprehending the human activities and interactions with the atmosphere is land use and land cover (LULC). 
- While land cover refers to that which covers the earth surface, land use defines the way in which land cover is transformed. 
- Land cover refers to artificial covers, rock/soil, water bodies, natural vegetation, and others found on the land. 
- Land use refers to the activities of human beings and various uses which are conducted over land. (Wildlife management areas, recreation area, built-up land, and agricultural land.)  
- The Earth's landscape has considerably been changed by a number of human activities including agriculture, urban development, and deforestation. 
- Engaging in exhaustive agriculture can possibly cause severe environmental consequences. 
- Forests play a major role within ecosystem balance. They reduce flooding and soil erosion. slow down surface runoff, intercepts precipitation. remove CO2 from the atmosphere, provide critical habitat for wildlife, and support biodiversity. 
- Because of overpopulation, prople tend to shift toward sensitive areas on earth, use land without taking into consideration the slope as well as the erodibility, which eventually results to severe soil erosion. (as well as road construction) 
- Metropolitan development hasa been connected to several environmental issues. These issues include wildlife habitat loss, pollution of water, and pollution of air. 
- In addition to nutrients sediments, urban runoff often has toxic contaminants, which cannot only pollute water but also cause variation in temperatures and streamflow. 
- All over the world, exhaustive agriculture and urban development in coastal areas and further inland are a key threat to marine environment biodiversity, productivity, and health. 

#### Spatial Processes and Spatial Pattern Identification (for Root Cause Analysis)
- Spatial processes and spatial patterns identification can make available answers to "where" kind of questions and can contribute to the comprehending of "why that is happening there." 
- It requires the adoption of a system method to understand the connection of environmental and social processes over space and time, and eventually cause climate changes. 
- In addition, the parameters of land surface such as surface roughness, soil moisture, leaf area index, and albedo are extremely sensitive to the conservations of land cover and affect the regional and local climate directly.

## Conventional Energy 

### 3.1 Wood 
- Wood, the most traditional conventional energy source since ancient time, is being widely used which indeed involves a complete destruction mechanism that elimates the natural resources and disturbs environmental balance. 
- The particular air pollutants from burning wood do cause human health problems such as asthma and heart diseases. 
- Burning wood also create CO and CO2 (GHGs). 
- Numerous research has been performed and revealed that particles which is the primary player for climate change. 
- By eliminating our reliance on wood for heating and cooking on burning wood, we can make a significant contribution to reduce GHGs, and then climate change. 

### 3.2 [**Coal**](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/Elem_Coal_Studyguide.pdf)
- **Coal** originated from remains of plants and ferns that grew in swamp area millions of years ago and is considered as the fossil fuel. 
- Microorganism and natural chemical compounds player a vital role to decompose those tree debris burried beneath water or mud and formed peat, which mainly consist cellulose (C6H10O5)n, and finally peat turned into coal. 
- [**How is coal formed?**](http://www.coaleducation.org/q&a/how_coal_formed.htm) 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147510356-028b3d17-2279-421f-a963-cb02bda8d9ac.png)

- The most efficient technique for coal extraction relies on the profundity and nature of the creases and the geological and environment factor components. 
- Most of the coal obtained from surface and subterranean mines is transferred to plants for washing and stockpiling. 
- Coal mining can be constructed either on surfave or underground or through other appropriate processes, and these are classified into several categories, surface mining, strip mining, contour mining, and underground mining. 
- **The coal industry has some negative impacts on the environment, including air and water contamination caused during coal extraction, processing, and consumption**. 
- **Apart from air contamination, consumption of coal product produces myriad amounts of hazardous waste products every year, such as fly ash, hot debris, and flue gas that contain radioactive material and other substantial metals**. 
- Surface mining of coal totally **wipe out existing plants, wrecks the traditional soil contour, disturbs natural life and living space, corrupts air quality, changes land utilizes, and, to some extent, changes whole geology of the region**. 


### 3.3 [**Petroleum**](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/petroleum/) 
- The utilization of petroleum was first invented in ancient China over 2000 years ago. In I Ching, one of the most punctual Chinese compositions refers to the use of oil in its crude from without refining, which was first found, removed, and used in parts of China in the first century BCE. 
- The three leading oil-producing nations are Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. 
- Petroleum is a derivative formed from old fossilized natural materials, for example, **zooplankton and algae**. 
### [**How is petroleum formed?**](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/) 
- Petroleum is a unique blend of hydrocarbons, for the most part, alkanes and cycloalkanes, originated from the vast amounts of these remaining parts settled to ocean or base of lake, blending through dregs in the absence of oxygen. As more layers sank into the ocean or sewaxy substance known as kerogen, which is found in different oil reserves worldwide, and subsequently more heat, time, and pressure are given into the fluid and vaporous hydrocabons through a process called catagenesis. The arrangement of oil happens from hydrocarbon decomposition due to variety of primarily endothermic reactions at high temperature as well as pressure. There were certain supplement-rich locations where a lot of natural material settling to the sea bottom surpassed the rate of its decomposition. This brought about huge loads of natural material being covered beneath the consequent stocks, for example, shale shaped from mud. This vast natural stock later ended up plainly warmed and changed underweight into petroleum.            
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147521154-6c369e66-f705-428a-a9af-203c71d4d2a2.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147526723-5f63fe66-e003-4e84-95d2-07a50d435bba.png)


- Latest technologies such as seismic mapping and imaging innovation have helped reserachers for signaling out gas and petroleum fields. 
- Seismologists can expose supply of hydrocarbons by using a supersensitive sound-discharging device such as geophones, which gives bobbing movement of shake development beneath the ground. 
- By recording the echoes and then analyzing 3D maps of them through supercomputers, it helps in finding the location of petroleum and gas fields in less time and also avoids the cost of standard exploration. 
- There are several ways to extract energy out of the petroleu mining, such as horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, deepwater drilling, and tar sands. 
- Humans use petroleum for fueling transportation, for keeping houses warm, and also in plastic and drug industry. 
### Environment impact of Petroleum 
- Air Contamination: CO2, CO, SO2, NOx, VOCs, PM, lead and other air toxins (benzene, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene). 
- Corrosive Rain. 
- Prtroleum Slicks. 
- Unstable Natural Mixes. 
- Climate Change. 

### 3.4 Natural Gas 
- Natural Gas was first found in old China when they were boring for salt water. It was first used by Chinese in aruond 500 BCE. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147680833-c68d516a-82cd-4188-a913-a4d3c424fb88.png)
- Natural gas is a typical blend of hydrocarbon gas comprising methane, yet sometimes it has some content of other alkanes and little level of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. 
### [**How is natural gas formed?**](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/) 
- When layers of decaying plant and animal matter remain under the surface of the earth with high pressure and heat for a long time, natural gas is formed. 
- Plants gain energy from sun, which is put away as a synthetic bond in the gas. 
- Most of the natural gas is developed by two systems, namely biogenic and thermogenic. 
- Methanogenic living organisms in swamps, landfills, and shallow residue make biogenic gas, whereas thermogenic gas is produced from covered natural material at greater depth with prominent heat and pressure. 
- There are other energy sources of gas, such as shale gas and town gas. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147681730-1673733b-4740-4975-a57e-7f115843c923.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147681751-5fcc2e39-cf5c-4c28-8f0c-23e27892a436.png)

### 3.5 Hydropower
- Hydropower is the most reliable, developed, and practical energy source innovation available to meet the daily energy demand. 
- The key elements of hydropower are rate of flow of liquid and water head. 
- Hydropower is one of the clean energy sources, yet there are many negative impacts of hydropower on environment. 
- Development of dam and power plant imposes many biology/physical changes on earth. 
- Oceanic and earthbound biological system nourishment web gets destroyed by operating hydropower plant. 
- Subsequently, potential effects must be analyzed, and tools such as Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment must be used to access the impacts of the project. 

### 3.6 Nuclear Energy 
- Radioactive element like U-235 can go through process of nuclear fission and generate abundant amount of nuclear energy. 
- Energy liberated from 1kg U-235 undergoing nuclear process would be approximately three million times more than that released by burning 1kg coal or 12 million barrels of oil. 
- Nuclear power is an efficient way of generating electricity in nuclear power plant by rotating turbines through steam induced by nuclear energy during nuclear reactions taking place in the reactor. 
- The radioactive waste stream from nuclear power plant consists of mainly unconverted uranium, other transuranic actinides (mostly plutonium and curium), and fission products, which both are responsible for radioactivity causing severe earth and human health issues. 

## Sustainable Energy 
- Sustainable energy is the type of energy that meets the current demand for energy with manageable environmental impacts. 
- In other words, it is the energy framework that **satisfies present requirement without compensating needs of future generation**. 
- The sustainable energy sources are the pilliars of sustainable energy, and use of them decreases the reliance on fossil fuels and gives a chance to alleviate GHGs. 

### 3.7 Solar Energy 
- Solar-based energy is using technologies to harness sun's light and energy to provide heat, electricity, and cooling. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147863426-d180d9bc-aea8-4b45-ae29-6821219614cc.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147863420-ab783a17-03bb-4eac-acec-490edb87a021.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147863406-8cde0989-5538-4b65-8a1a-47427f857f54.png)


### 3.8 Wind Energy 
- Wind energy is utilization of wind to rotate the blades of turbine which is connected to generator to produce electricity. 

### 3.9 Geothermal Energy 
- The geothermal energy is energy stored inside the earth, originated from the planet and the radioactive waste. 
- The geothermal gradient called magma is the difference in temperature between the earth's surface and center of the earth, and it drives a continues conduction of heat from the center of the planet to its cover. 
- The temperature at the core-mantle may reach as high as 4000 C. 
- In this system, cold water seeps into the hot earth's crust, heats up, and rises to earth's surface as steam. 

### 3.10 Biogas Energy 
- Biogas produced by the decay of organic matter in the absence of oxygen is considered as a renewable source of energy. 
- It can be produced from materials such as agricultural waste, compost, metropolitan waste, plant material, or sewage. 
- The fundamental structure of biogas consists of methane (CH4) and CO2 and might have the small percentage of H2S, dampness, and siloxanes where mathane and hydrogen can be combusted to generate energy for cooking and heating ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) purpose. 
 
 _____________________________________________________________
 
 ## Advanced Building Design 
 - The population growth and industrial development are serious impacting envirionment because conventional energy generation processes are polluting the environment and causing the climate change. 
 - Global demand for energy services is expected to increase by as much as one order of magnitude by 2050, whereas primary energy demands are expected to increase by nearly two times.  
 - Because the fossil energy resources are finite, Marion King Hubbert at Shell (1956) predicted that crude oil production in the world would peak around 1970, then it will start to decline due to the shortage of fossil fuel.

### Biogas Conversion from Human Feces and Domestic Waste                                       
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/147863923-4c20674e-8494-4133-a305-e89ddcb04bf1.png)([**Waste to Energy**](https://www.basicknowledge101.com/categories/wasteenergy.html))

### Cool and Heat the Building Naturally 
- Traditional cooling and heating systems adopted by the building sector are problematic as they contribute to climate change and threaten the ozone layer. 
- To mitigate these potentially catastrophic effects, the present reseachers have proposed transforming solar irradiation into cooled photons by implementing the Bose-Einstein photon distribution mechanism on helium-assisteed curtain walls, which can be installed on the external surfaces of buildings. 
- The cooled photons are then available for cooling the building. 

### Building Information Modeling (BIM) 
[**What is BIM**](https://www.lodplanner.com/what-is-bim/)
#### Backgroud
- With the increase in knowledge of energy utilization in addition to the environmental effect of the operations of the building, it is required that more considerations are made by the architects, designers, and planners on sustainability and energy functioning of the building. 
- Crucial design choices must be made by important parties initially in the design-development phase to ensure most of these points are shown in the building functioning. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88390140/148001237-a35985ca-a8d1-4dfa-8f4c-5cfa4cc47125.png)

#### Definition: 
- BIM represents a process that involves generating and managing digital/vitural representations of natural and working features of places. 
- BIMs are documents that can be extracted, replaced, or exchanged and thus assist in arriving at a conclusion about any infrastructures such as roads, bridges, ports, tunnels, communication utilities, water, gas, electricity, refuse, and so forth. 

#### Application: 
- Conventional building design (like Computer Aided Design (CAD)) was heavily dependent on 2D technica drawing which included plans, sections, elevations, and so forth. 
- BIM takes this to a new level, even past 3D, supplementing the three main spatial dimensions (width, height, and depth) with the additional fourth dimension as time (4D) and fifth one as cost (5D). 
- BIM usage is not only limited to the planning and design stage of the project but also spans all through the building life cycle. 
- BIM in Construction Management. 
- BIM in FAcility Operation. 
- BIM in Land Administration and CAdastre. 

### Energy Simulation and Building Performance Model

### Building Automation System (BAS) 
- Smart building technology, through a building automation system (BAS), is the concentrated controller of the facility's heating, lighting, air conditioning and ventilation, and energy supply via automation. 
- Improvement in the comfort of the occupants, effective operation of building systems, reducing the operating cost and energy consumption, and improvement in the life cycle of utilities are the objectives of building automation. 
- In addition to controlling indoor and outdoor lighting, modern BAS can also help in controlling fire alarm, security, and almost everything else that uses electricity in the building. 
- Constituent: Portocols, Sensors, Controls and Controller.
