## Introduction: 
- **Sustainabile Environment**: the biological systems must remain productive and diverse for an indefinite period of time. 

- **Sustainable energy** is an urgent demand to serve the needs of the present without compromissing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. 
- Types of renewable energy: hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind energy, wave power, geothermal energy, bioenergy, tidal power, and technologies to improve energy effciency. 

- Changes that need to be made on the present-day conventional energy consumption will not only be on **how energy is supplied** but also on **how it is used**, and it is important to reduce the volume of energy needed to deliver different goods and/or services. 

- **Sustainable building** refer to both the structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building's life cycle from planning to design, constructure, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. 
- All over the world, buildings have been identified to consume very large portions of natural resources including water and energy. In the present day, buildings are responsible for 40% of the worldwide CO2 emissions, which is equal to 9 billion tons of carbon dioxide yearly, and by 2050, these emissions are likely to double. 
- Utilizing sunlight via photovoltaic equipment, active annd passive solar, trees and planets via rainwater runoff reduction, rain gardens, and green roofs. 
- Utilizing low-effect constructing materials and using permeable concrete or packed gravel rather than asphalt or conventional concrete to improve groundwater replenishment . 
- **Design clean building**: identifying "green" materials of building from indigenous sources, reducing loads, optimizing systems, and finally producing on-site renewable energy. 

- **Traditional (Building&Transportation) Infrastructure** is causing losses lands. Progressively, the biodiversity loss within the environment mainly from the habitat fragmentation and loss. (as well as agriculture.) 

- **Traditional Transport systems** have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for nearly 28% of world energy conventional consumption, and it is causing proportional climate change and adverse environmental impact. 

- **Sustainable Transportation**: the advanced vehicle technology to be used for road, water, or air transport by using renewable and clean energy, where the infrastructure should be able to accommodate the clean fuel-operated transport to mitigate energy and traffic jam crisis.
