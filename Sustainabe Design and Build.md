## Introduction: 
### 1.1 **Sustainabile Environment**:
the biological systems must remain productive and diverse for an indefinite period of time. 

### 1.2 **Sustainable energy** 
is an urgent demand to serve the needs of the present without compromissing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. 
- Types of renewable energy: hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind energy, wave power, geothermal energy, bioenergy, tidal power, and technologies to improve energy effciency. 

- Changes that need to be made on the present-day conventional energy consumption will not only be on **how energy is supplied** but also on **how it is used**, and it is important to reduce the volume of energy needed to deliver different goods and/or services. 

### 1.3 **Sustainable building** 
refer to both the structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building's life cycle from planning to design, constructure, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. 
- All over the world, buildings have been identified to consume very large portions of natural resources including water and energy. In the present day, buildings are responsible for 40% of the worldwide CO2 emissions, which is equal to 9 billion tons of carbon dioxide yearly, and by 2050, these emissions are likely to double. 
- Utilizing sunlight via photovoltaic equipment, active annd passive solar, trees and planets via rainwater runoff reduction, rain gardens, and green roofs. 
- Utilizing low-effect constructing materials and using permeable concrete or packed gravel rather than asphalt or conventional concrete to improve groundwater replenishment . 
- **Design clean building**: identifying "green" materials of building from indigenous sources, reducing loads, optimizing systems, and finally producing on-site renewable energy. 

- **Traditional (Building&Transportation) Infrastructure** is causing losses lands. Progressively, the biodiversity loss within the environment mainly from the habitat fragmentation and loss. (as well as agriculture.) 

### 1.4 **Sustainable Transportation**: 
the advanced vehicle technology to be used for road, water, or air transport by using renewable and clean energy, where the infrastructure should be able to accommodate the clean fuel-operated transport to mitigate energy and traffic jam crisis. 

- **Traditional Transport systems** have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for nearly 28% of world energy conventional consumption, and it is causing proportional climate change and adverse environmental impact. 

### 1.5 **Water**: 
covers 75% of the Earth's surface, out of this, 97% is the salty water of the oceans and **only 3% freshwater**, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. (glaciers: 69%, **groundwater: 30%**, whereas **all lakes, rivers and swamps: 0.3%**. 

- Although, the supply of freshwater is constantly replenished through precipitation because of the water cycle, within the last several decades, groundwater strata have been getting lower nearly 10m, scaring the groundwater finite level in the near future. 

- In contrast, rising urbanization contaminates freshwater supplies, thereby triggering adverse environmental impact, which eventually alarms the survival of all living beings on Earth due to the shortage of drinkable water near future. 

- **Importance of Water**: The living body metabolic (catabolism and anabolism); Plant photosynthesis and respiration; Agriculture, Home and Industry. 
- In catabolism, water is utilized to break the bonds within large molecules to create smaller molecules, and in anabolism, water is detached from molecules to create larger molecules. 
- Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off hydrogen from oxygen in water. Afterward, hydrogen is mixed with carbon dioxide (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose that is utilized as their food and release oxygen to balance the ecosystem. 

- **Sustainable Water**: (much more scientifically and technologically advanced research and development must be applied) 
1. physical and chemical treatment processes for water and wastewater treatment process, 
2. environment biotechnology for use in the water resource management and bioremediation, and utilize wastewater into useful product, 
3. watershed and wetland management to reduce the water loss, 
4. advanced environment engineering design to mitigate the groundwater, 
5. sustainable water resource development as a new source of water supply.

## Environment

### 2.1 Air 
- Currently the atmospheric CO2 is 400 ppm ï¼ˆcontinues to rapid increase),  60,000 ppm means all living being will die in 30 mins. 
- :star::star::star::star::star: [**CO2 Link**](https://netl.doe.gov/coal/carbon-storage/faqs/carbon-dioxide-101) 

### 2.2 Water 
- The conventional wastewater treatment has the lack of suspended particulate matter analysis and good analytical approaches which results in aquatic environment and agricultural land got pollutant and hence poison organisms. 
- Monitoring spatial and temporal variability of Emerging Contaminates in wastewater and river water will become important. 

### 2.3 Land 
- A vital component in comprehending the human activities and interactions with the atmosphere is land use and land cover (LULC). 
- While land cover refers to that which covers the earth surface, land use defines the way in which land cover is transformed. 
- Land cover refers to artificial covers, rock/soil, water bodies, natural vegetation, and others found on the land. 
- Land use refers to the activities of human beings and various uses which are conducted over land. (Wildlife management areas, recreation area, built-up land, and agricultural land.)  
- The Earth's landscape has considerably been changed by a number of human activities including agriculture, urban development, and deforestation. 
- Engaging in exhaustive agriculture can possibly cause severe environmental consequences. 
- Forests play a major role within ecosystem balance. They reduce flooding and soil erosion. slow down surface runoff, intercepts precipitation. remove CO2 from the atmosphere, provide critical habitat for wildlife, and support biodiversity. 
- Because of overpopulation, prople tend to shift toward sensitive areas on earth, use land without taking into consideration the slope as well as the erodibility, which eventually results to severe soil erosion. (as well as road construction) 
- Metropolitan development hasa been connected to several environmental issues. These issues include wildlife habitat loss, pollution of water, and pollution of air. 
- In addition to nutrients sediments, urban runoff often has toxic contaminants, which cannot only pollute water but also cause variation in temperatures and streamflow. 
- All over the world, exhaustive agriculture and urban development in coastal areas and further inland are a key threat to marine environment biodiversity, productivity, and health. 

#### Spatial Processes and Spatial Pattern Identification (for Root Cause Analysis)
- Spatial processes and spatial patterns identification can make available answers to "where" kind of questions and can contribute to the comprehending of "why that is happening there." 
- It requires the adoption of a system method to understand the connection of environmental and social processes over space and time, and eventually cause climate changes. 
- In addition, the parameters of land surface such as surface roughness, soil moisture, leaf area index, and albedo are extremely sensitive to the conservations of land cover and affect the regional and local climate directly.
