## 1. Motivation 
- There is a growing appreciation of the importance in developed societies of networks (or lifelines) of various kinds, such as water supply, energy supply, sewage disposal, communication and of course transportation. 
- Mobility and accessibility are major determinants of lifestyle and prosperity.

- A rigorous consideration of the kinds of land use and transport issues just raised requires the appropriate tools to analyse tranportation networks and travel behaviour within them. 

## 2. Transportation Network 
- A transportation network is a *flow network* representing the movement of people, vehicle or goods. 
- **Topology**: Any transportation network can be represented as a *graph* in the mathematical sense, consisting of a set of *links* and a set of *nodes*. 
- **Flow properties**: Origin-Destination Demands, Capacity Constraints, Path Choice, Link Cost Functions, and etc. 
- The demand for transport is arising out of economic, social or personal activities. (Two modes: Private Transport & Public Transport)
