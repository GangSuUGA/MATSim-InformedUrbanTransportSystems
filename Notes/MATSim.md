## Why MATSim (or Shortages of 4-Steps)? 
 - Inefficency of the Gravity Model for some area. 
 - Inequality of the population state of practice models assume a fairly homogeneous population. 

## What is MATSim? 
 - Highly recommended watch this video: [**Introduction - Part C - What is MATSim?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowP4f9ntCA&t=0s) 
 - MATSim is based on the **co-evolutionary principle**. **Every Travelers (agents)** repeatedly optimizes its **daily activity schedule (plans)** while in competition for space-time slots with all other agents on the transportation infrastructure. This is somewhat similar to the route assignment iterative cycle, but goes **beyond route assignment** by incorporating other choice dimensions like **time choice**, **mode choice**, or **destination choice** into the **iterative loop**.

 - MATSim performs integral microscopic simulation of **resulting traffic flows** and **the congestion** they produce.  

 - Implemented in **Java**. Modular and extendable.

The opportunities brought about by information technologies are clear in the area of mobility: 
we are seeing the advent of **autonomous vehicles**, **connected vehicles**, **shared mobility**, **mobility-on-demand**, and **mobility-as-a-service**, all due to advances in **information and communications technologies**.
