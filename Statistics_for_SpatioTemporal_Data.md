## Some thinking 

- Data are central, however, data alone do not tell us all that much about our world, how to use data to form theories? 
- How do we know if what we are seeing is "signal" as opposed to "noise"? 
- 

## Space-Time：The Next Frontier 

- Spatio-temporal data: data to which labels have been added showing where and when they were collected. 
- We believe that in order to answer the "why" question (cause-effect relationships), Science should address the "where" and "when” questions. 
- Spatio-temporal data were essential to the nomadic tribes of early civilization, who used them to return to seasonal hunting grounds. On a grander scale, datasets on location, weather, geology, plants, animals, and indigneous people were collected by early explorers seeking to map new lands and enrich their kings and queens. 
- The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein compaered language to a city that has evolved over time (Wittgenstein, 1958): "Our language can be seen as an ancient city: A maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods!"
- Graphs of data indexed by time (time series) and remote-sensing images made up of radiances indexed by pixel location (spatial data) show variability at a glance. 

## Uncertainty and the Role of Statistics 
- Uncertainty is everywhere. 
- In most of this book, we shall express uncertainty through variablilty, but we note that other measures (e.g., entropy) could also be used. 
- Although real-world systems may in principle be partially deterministic, our information is incomplete at each of the stages of observation, summarization, and inference, and thus our understanding is clouded by uncertainty. 
- Since the data are nearly always statistically dependent in space and time, and hence most of the traditional statistical methods (which assume iid errors) do not apply or have to be modified. 

## Uncertainty and Models 
- Science attempts to explain the world in which we live, but that world is very complex. 
- A model is a simplification of some well chosen aspects of the world, where the level of complexity often depends on the question being asked. 
- Pragmatically, the goal of a model is to predict, and at the same time scientists want to incorporate their understanding of how the world works into their models. 
- Models that are scientifically meaningful, that predict well, and that are conceptually simple are generally preferred. 
- Albert Rinstein: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
