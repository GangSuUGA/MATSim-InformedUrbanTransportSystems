# Resilient Infrastructure Systems

- Infrastructure systems support the basic needs and functions of modern industrialized society including energy, water and sewage, transportation, communications, and public facilities.  

- Resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities and systems to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions, recover from threats, and thrive in the future.  
- The Resilient Infrastructure Systems program focuses on innovative solutions that help communities systems mitigate risks and seize opportunities associated with environmental change, extreme weather and climate-related events by rethinking, transforming, and adapting infrastructure systems to strengthen economic, environmental, and social resilience.
